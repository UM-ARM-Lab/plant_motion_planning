This file contains the notes for the movement of the robotic arm. 

Steps for movement:
1. Generate grasps
	a. A grasp generator is used to generate viable poses of grasp. 
	b. The grasp pose is generated by multiplying the tool pose with several other data, kind of making it like a transform. 
	c. In the case of 'side_only' grasp, 2 grasps are produced per side (say, left and right). Each of these grasps are then later tested (towards step 2 and 3) for collision. So the four graps are left and top, left and bottom, right and top and right and bottom (not necessarily in that order).
2. Use the inverse kinematics methods. 
3. Calculate the motion between the initial and final configurations
